        <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
        	    <p>My name is Avitha. I have two parents, three sisters and two dogs. My parents names 
        	    are Arvind and Kam, my sisters names are Aariel, Amber and Aarti and my dogs names are 
        	    London and Leo. My birthday is the 20th of July and I find myself to be lucky that its during
        	    summer. I have done my fair share of traveling. Ive been to LA, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Arizona,
        	    Mexico and India. Ive been very lucky. </p>	
                <p>There are a lot of things I like to do and that I would like to do. I love art. I love artwork,
                the art of writing and the art of poetry. I spend much of the day brainstorming ideas for stories 
                and then writing/drawing my ideas down. I also enjoy playing video games, but contrary to popular 
                opinion I am against violent video games and prefer those made 15+ years ago. Someday I hope to create
                my own games and movies.</p>

        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
            <h3>Long Term Goals</h3>
                <p> I have been getting 4.0s all through my freshmen year and I don't intend to stop. 
                 I intend to get all As through the rest of my education. Therefore,
                 I want to graduate from high school as a valedictorian.</p>
                <p> I have noticed that this generation is extremely inappropriate and messed up. 
                Yet, for some reason I am not. Then I concluded that it was because i don't play
                dirty videogames or watch dirty TV shows like most people. This is why
                I hope to save the generation of today by creating fun, clean videogames.</p>
            <h3>Short Term Goals</h3>
                <p> grades have always been my main priorty. The minute I realize somethin has gone
                wrong, I work to fix it. This ambition of mine has definitely not changed.I want 
                to maintain a 4.0 for the rest of the year. </p> 
                <p>lately I have been struggling with balance. I used to go home, finish my homework
                in less than a half hour and spend the rest of my day relaxing. Now my workload has
                tripled and I get out of school an hour later. I want to learn to balance my time doing 
                homework, playing videogames, drawing and spending time with my family.</p>
        <h2 id="accomplishments">Accomplishments</h2>
            <h3>Educational</h3>
                <p>My grades are my biggest accomplishments education wise. I have been a 4.0 student
                throughout 9th grade. By the end of every semester, I make sure I have a 4.0, or higher
                if possible. My transcript shows all of my As and that makes me happy.</p>
            <h3>Personal</h3>
                <p>In the times of late, my house has been absolutely hectic. Yelling, screaming, threatening, etc.
                Through these times I have managed to remain sane. I keep a positive attitude and I  am always 
                the one in the house who you can count on for logic. I find that maintaining my cool in these
                hectic times is quite the accomplishment.</p>
